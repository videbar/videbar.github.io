        <div class="post-content">
            <p>As I'm learning about computer vision, I built a prototype of a license plate
recognition system to get familiar with some of the tools and concepts used the field.
This is a summary of how I built such as a system and how it works.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="what-i-mean-by-license-plate-recognition">What I mean by license plate recognition</h1>
<p>Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems take a video feed or a static image
and extract the license plate number of any vehicles shown. They are widely used for
vehicle recognition, access control, parking-spot management, etc. In general, an ANPR
system consists of two elements, a sub-system that identifies the license plate in the
image or video, and another one that extracts and interprets the alphanumeric
characters. This project is only concerned with the first part, the identification of
license plates in car images.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ANPR systems can be classified in two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed systems, which are installed at a given location and do not move (hence the
name). These are the systems that are used, among other things, to identify vehicles
at a parking entrance. When working with fixed systems, the car images are all taken,
more or less, from the same distance and at the same angle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile systems, which are portable and designed to be used in a wider range of
circumstances. They are used, for example, by law enforcement to identify vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, I am modelling a fixed ANPR system, thus, in all data images, the relative
position between the camera and the car is more or less the same.</p>
<p>I used data from the <a href="https://www.zemris.fer.hr/projects/LicensePlates/english/results.shtml">Department of Electronics, Microelectronics, Computer and Intelligent
Systems of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing of the University of
Zagreb</a> to
develop and test the system, but the techniques and implementation should work on any
dataset with minor adjustments.</p>
<h1 id="design-overview">Design overview</h1>
<p>When given an image of the rear part of a car, the license plate recognition system
should be able to <em>choose</em> which part of the image corresponds to the license plate. In
order to simplify this task, I considered the hypothetical ANPR system to be fixed,
i.e., the relative pose (distance and orientation) of the cars with respect to the camera
is somewhat constant across different images. Based on this, it can be assumed that the
license plate in all images is going to be around the same size. Thus, if the license
plate size is known, the system <em>just</em> needs to be able to tell which of all the
possible sub-images of that size looks more like a license plate.</p>
<p>All images in the dataset I used are 640 pixels by 480, and by inspecting them, it's
easy to see that the size of the license plate in most cases is about 300 pixels by 64.
I should point out that some of the images in the database show special vehicles, such
as heavy trucks, which have plates of different shapes or colors. To keep thing simple,
I didn't consider those special plates for this first prototype.</p>
<p>The license plate recognition algorithm is then designed to work in the following
manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It takes an image of size 640x480.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It crops the image to generate some number of sub-images of size 300x64. The cropping
should be done in a way that ensures that one of these sub-images shows the entire
license plate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It applies a classification algorithm to identify which of the sub-images contains
the license plate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="the-classification-algorithm">The classification algorithm</h1>
<p>To distinguish between the 300x64 images that show a license plates and the ones that
don't, I used a classification algorithm based on the k-nearest-neighbors (knn) method.
In general, this algorithm works by taking some piece of data and assigning it to one of
a set of categories, which are known in advanced. This is achieved by first exposing the
algorithm to a training dataset, composed of data points of which the category to which
they belong is known. When a new data point is given to the algorithm, it compares it to
the points in the training data set to find one that <em>resemble</em> the new data point. The
training data points that are similar to the new one are called its nearest-neighbors.
The new data point is assigned to the same category as its nearest-neighbors.</p>
<p>The way this is technically implemented requires a way of describing the data points
using numerical properties. For example, let's say that we want to classify animals into
the categories &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot;. We can describe animals using their weight and height,
thus we'll need a training dataset which will consist of the weight and height of some
sheep and some cats. When the system is presented with a new animal, it compares the
weight and height of the mysterious creature with the training data set. If both values
are relatively similar to the values corresponding to the cats in the training dataset,
then it's a cat, if it's closer to a sheep, then it's a sheep.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the numerical properties used to describe the data points can be used to
construct a vector space. Since in this example we only have two properties, weight and
height, the space will be two-dimensional and we can represent the training data-points
as literal points:</p>

  
  
    
    
  
  <img src="https://www.vide.bar/images/blog/license_plate_recognition_system/ikk_classifier_sheep_cat.svg" class="center" decoding="async" loading="lazy">

<p>When the algorithm is given a new point that needs to be classified, a new animal of
unknown specie, its weight and height can be represented on the same plot:</p>

  
  
    
    
  
  <img src="https://www.vide.bar/images/blog/license_plate_recognition_system/ikk_classifier_sheep_cat_unknown.svg" class="center" decoding="async" loading="lazy">

<p>Intuitively, it's easy to see that the new animal is more likely to be a cat than a
sheep. Mathematically, the closest training point is of type &quot;cat&quot;, so the new point is
also assigned to the same category. It should be noted that we can check more than one
of the nearest neighbors; both the number of nearest-neighbors that are considered and
the mathematical definition of &quot;nearest&quot; can be tweaked when applying the algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="the-histogram-of-oriented-gradients">The histogram of oriented gradients</h2>
<p>I used the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm classify the sub-images into the categories
&quot;license plate&quot; or &quot;other&quot;, but in order to apply it, I needed a way of describing the
images using a set of numerical values, like the weight and height in the example. The
histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a method used to describe images using
numerical values that was popularized in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1467360">a 2005 paper by N. Dalal and B. Triggs</a> that used it to identify pedestrian in
images. It works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, the gradients of all the pixels in the image are calculated. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient">The
gradient</a> is a mathematical concept that
measures how much a multi-variable function changes. In the case of an image, it
gives an idea of how different a given pixel is from the ones in its surroundings. In
particular, the gradient is composed of two things, the direction in which the most
different pixel can be located, and a measurement of how different that other pixel
is. The HOG descriptors are built using the former.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the first step is completed, I have, for each pixel, a value that indicates the
direction of maximum change. These directions can be expressed as an angle, for
example, if the most different pixel is completely to the right, that can be 0°, if
it's straight up, then it would be 90°, and so on. In order to simplify the data, the
angle values are then grouped together in buckets of amplitude 20°, i.e., any angle
from 0° to 20°, goes to the first bucket, any angle from 20° to 40° to the second
one, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearby pixels are grouped into cells. The cells are non-overlapping and their size can
be specified as an algorithm-parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, we have divided the images into cells. Each cell has a given number of
pixels and each pixel has a gradient-angle associated with it. Also, the
gradient-angles are grouped into a small number of buckets. The next step is to
build, for each cell, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a> that
describe how the angles of the pixels in that cells are distributed among the
different buckets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we group the cells into blocks. The different between a cell and a block is
that blocks are overlapping, this is, a single cell can belong to multiple blocks.
The HOG descriptor of the image is then a vector that contains the normalized
angle-histograms of every block.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know more about the HOG algorithm, but don't want to read the academic
paper, <a href="https://medium.com/@dnemutlu/hog-feature-descriptor-263313c3b40d">here</a> you can
find a more detailed explanation with nice graphics and animations.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that the HOG method can be used to obtain numerical descriptors of
images that can then be fed into the k-nearest-neighbors classification algorithm.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>I implemented the prototype in Matlab, using the <a href="https://es.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html">Computer Vision
Toolbox</a>, the <a href="https://es.mathworks.com/products/image.html">Image Processing
Toolbox</a>, and the <a href="https://es.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html">Statistics and Machine
Learning Toolbox</a>. The complete
implementation can be found on <a href="https://github.com/videbar/license-plate-detector">my Github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="training-data">Training data</h2>
<p>The images I used to train the algorithm can be found
<a href="https://github.com/videbar/license-plate-detector/tree/main/data/training">here</a>. For
each of the training images, I manually selected a 300x64 sub-image that matched the
license plate of the vehicle, to be used as a training data point for the &quot;license
plate&quot; category. For the &quot;other&quot; training data, I cropped each of the training images
into random sub-images of size 300x64. Then, I manually revised these sub-images to
remove any that contain parts of the license plates. Here are some examples of the
images used for training, both for the &quot;license plate&quot; and &quot;other&quot; categories:</p>

<p>For the tests, I used images that were not in the training set, and the classifier
passed all all of them.</p>
<p>Finally, I put all the parts together; the complete system takes an input image, divides
it into sub-images using constant horizontal and vertical intervals, and computes the
HOG descriptors of all the sub-images. Then, it uses the knn classifier to select the
sub-image(s) that best qualify as license plates. In the case that two or more sub-images
are tied as the best ones, the method averages their x-y coordinates, since it's
probably caused by multiple images containing different sections of the license plate:</p>

<p>As it can be here the results are quite nice for such a simple prototype:</p>

</p>
<p>One problem with the system seems to be that the dimensions of the license plate across
different images is not as constant as I was expecting. As a result, in some images,
even though the algorithm selects the correct area, the 300x64 selection is too large.</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to have a look at is the method used to generate the
sub-images from the complete image. Here, I used the simplest approach, cropping the
image at constant intervals, but it would be nice to investigate more efficient ways of
doing it.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm quite happy with the system, the results are better that what I was
expecting, and it was nice to apply these techniques to a small project such as this
one.</p>
