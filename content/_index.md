Hey, my name is Pedro, I enjoy learning new things and, in particular, I like applying
what I learn to concrete projects. This webpage is a place where I write about what I'm
learning/doing.

I know about physics, electronics, and programming, and I have a special interest in
hardware-related topics. In the past, I've worked on various projects related to
microcontrollers, signal processing, data analysis, cryptography, and communication
protocols. Currently, I'm working on things related to computer vision, control systems
and embedded programming.

I'm also interested in understanding the interactions between technology, and our
society; this includes being aware of the social costs of technologies, and
recognizing the assumptions they make about the world.


You can have a look at [my blog](@/blog/_index.md), where I will be uploading posts
at an irregular and unpredictable rate. If they seem interesting, you can subscribe to
[the rss feed](https://www.vide.bar/rss.xml).
