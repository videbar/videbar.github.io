Hey, my name is Pedro and you just landed on my personal webpage. I enjoy learning new
things and, in particular, I like applying what I learn to concrete projects. This
webpage is a place where I  write about what I'm learning/doing.

I know about physics, electronics, and programming, and I have a special
interest in hardware-related topics. In the past, I've worked on various projects
related to microcontrollers, signal processing, data analysis, cryptography, and
communication protocols.
Currently, I'm learning about [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), embedded programming
and control systems.

I'm also interested in understanding and being aware of the effects that different
technologies have on our society.


You can have a look at [my blog](@/blog/_index.md), where I will be uploading posts
at an irregular and unpredictable rate. If they seem interesting, you can subscribe to
[the rss feed](https://www.vide.bar/rss.xml).
