Hey, my name is Pedro and you just landed on my personal webpage. I enjoy learning new
things and, in particular, I like applying what I learn to concrete projects. This
webpage is a place where I  write about what I'm learning/doing.

I know about physics, electronics, Linux and  python programming and I have a special
interest in hardware-related projects. I am also interested in how the different ways
in which technology is used affect our society.

Currently I am learning about [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [verilog](
https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) and I recently [wrote a small Python program](
@/blog/buiding_a_python_cli_application_to_manage_my_bookmarks.md) to manage my ereader
bookmarks. [The projects page](@/pages/projects.md) contains a summary of stuff I've
worked on in the past. You can also have a look at [my blog](@/blog/_index.md), where I
will be uploading stuff at an irregular and unpredictable rate. You can even subscribe
to [the rss feed](https://www.vide.bar/rss.xml).
